# Beheading a Hydra: Kingpin Extradition, Homicides, Education Outcomes, and the End of Medellin’s Pax Mafiosa
What happens when the leadership is severed from a highly consolidated, violent mafia organization? If it increases violence, are the consequences confined to gang-affiliated individuals, or are there costs for society as a whole?

### Context
In 2008, a major narcotics kingpin named Don Berna was extradited from Colombia to the United States. In his stronghold of Medellin, the resulting power vacuum in the
city’s criminal economy set off an internecine war for power that saw homicide rates in the city double, before organized crime governance structures finally re-consolidated and violence returned to pre-extradition levels.
