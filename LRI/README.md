# Evaluation of Littorals Regional Initiative in Ghana
#### Highlighted Skills: Research design, survey design, causal inference, mixed methods research, project management

Randomized control trial (RCT) of a violence mediation program in Northern Ghana.

### Context
Farmers and Fulbe cattle herders in Northern Ghana have a long history of co-existence, but a combination of factors has led to increased incidence of crop destruction and conflict in recent decades. USAID/OTI’s Littorals Regional Initiative (LRI) partnered with Ghanian NGOs CECOTAPS and Save Ghana to implement strategies for mediating farmer-herder conflict and better integrating ethnic Fulbe into local communities.

LRI wanted to rigorously evaluate the strategy to quantify its effects and attribute causality to its programming. The evaluation’s purpose reflected LRI’s interest in evaluating the validity, effectiveness, and efficiency of the strategy, providing insight on how to best support community-level conflict mitigation interventions. 

### My Work
As Principal Investigator (PI), I conducted focus groups and in-depth interviews during a scoping trip to better understand the program context, validate assumptions, and identify outcome indicators.

I randomized 46 communities in Ghana’s Upper West region into treatment or control conditions using a matched pair randomization design. I oversaw baseline surveys in November 2023 with farmer and herder households and community leaders, measuring outcomes related to community cohesion, dispute resolution, and security conditions. We returned one year later to conduct endline surveys with the same households and community leaders. A total of 920 households and 92 community leaders were interviewed, evenly divided between farmers and herders, and across the 46 communities. Focus group discussions in treatment communities provided additional context for the quantitative results.

### Result
Completed just a few months after program implementation, endline analysis found evidence for positive impacts of LRI’s approach across several outcome indicators. I also identified several areas where treatment communities experienced the intervention unevenly. 

After the endline analysis, I led a workshop with key stakeholders, presenting results and conclusions, and leading an interactive session to validate the conclusions and translate findings into actionable recommendations.
