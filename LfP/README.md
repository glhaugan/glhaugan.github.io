# Evaluation of Land for Prosperity in Colombia
#### Highlighted Skills: Research design, survey design, causal inference, mixed methods research, project management

Quasi-experimental evaluation of a land formalization program in Colombia.

### Context
Many properties in rural Colombia lack a formal land title, which contributes to forced displacement and land conflict, difficulty in obtaining financing to make productivity investments on farms, and illicit crop cultivation. 

LfP works to conduct mass land titling, providing the inputs necessary for entire communities to formalize their land. LfP wanted to measure the effects of land formalization, providing evidence to leverage private sector investment in these efforts.

### My Work
As co-Principal Investigator (co-PI), I conducted focus groups and in-depth interviews during a scoping trip to better understand the program context, validate assumptions, and identify outcome indicators.

I collected administrative and GIS data on communities and performed statistical matching in R to pair treatment communities with statistically similar comparison communities. I developed contingency plans for conducting fieldwork in conflict zones during a global pandemic, and oversaw baseline household surveys in April 2021 with 3,000 rural households, measuring outcomes related to perceptions of tenure security, agricultural productivity, illicit crop cultivation, and conflict. 

### Result
After the baseline analysis, I led a workshop with key stakeholders, presenting results and recommendations to improve program rollout.
